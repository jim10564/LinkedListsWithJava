# Programming Project 3 – Linked Lists in Java

# Objective

The objective of this Programming Project is to apply the concepts of Linked Lists in Java.  

### Program Description

This project manages two Linked Lists. One  list represents the students who are are registered in the class and hence are on the class roster. The other list should represent the students who could not get into course and hence are on the Wait-list of the course. 

**Conditions for adding students on to both the lists:**

The linked list size of Class Roster as 5. When the Class Roster linked list size is full, next student to be added is to be added on the Wait-list Linked List. The student gets added at the end of the Wait-list Linked List.

**Condition for dropping a student:**

There are menu options that allow students to be dropped out of either of the two lists. If the student drops out of Class Roster linked list, then the first element on Wait-list linked list is removed and added to the Class Roster linked list. If the student drops out of the Wait-list linked list, then simply remove that student from the Wait-list linked list. (Search is done with the Student ID.)



**The following methods are available as menu options:**

• Find a Student

• Add a Student

• Drop a Student

• Print all Students (Both Class Roster and on Wait-List)

• Quit
